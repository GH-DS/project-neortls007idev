- ESDF (Xbox left stick) to drive forward and turn the tank toward a direction
- IJKL (Xbox right stick) to turn the turret toward a direction
- P to toggle Pause/Unpause while Playing
- ESC exits game.

- F1 (cheat) toggles debug drawing of inner (cyan) and outer (magenta) radii
- F3 (cheat) toggles noclip mode (disables physics for player tank only)
- F4 (cheat) toggles debug camera (vs. normal game camera), view entire map
- F8 (cheat) deletes and re-creates a new Game object, sets mode to Playing
- T (cheat) hold to sustain slow-motion (0.1x timescale)
- Y (cheat) hold to sustain fast-motion (4.0x timescale)

	3. Double-click Protogame2D_x64.exe to start the program.

Method 2(for advanced users):-

	1. Extract the zip folder to you desired location.
	2. Open the following path --> …\SD\Protogame2D
	3. Open the Protogame2D.sln using Visual Studio 2019.

Deep Learning
	
	Using external libraries can be troubesome if you don't have a complete working understanding of 
which functions are necessary and which functions are not. I also learned that certain programs and functions may work and behave differently as what you may be assuming them to be, I learned this by texturing magnification code assuming that I don't need it. Another thing I learned that there are certain edge cases which we need to account for sometimes for certain engine systems like the physics system to work correctly.
